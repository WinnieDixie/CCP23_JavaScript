Data Types
-undefined
variables are declared with the initial value of undefined
-null

-boolean

-string
"12"
-symbol

-bigint

-number
12
-object

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data. (var)
Can not start with numbers or have spaces. 
var myName;

__________________
Storing Values in Variables
assignment (=)
var a;
a = 7;

__________________
Assigning the value of one variable to another
var a;
a = 7;
var b;
b = a;
Be careful of order

__________________
Initialize variables with the assignment operator
var a = 9;

__________________
Declare string Variables
-string literal
a series of zeros or characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
var myFirstName = "Your first name";
var myLastName = "Your last name";

__________________
Uninitialized variables
JavaScript variables are declared with the initial value of undefined.
If used in a mathematical operation; result will be NaN.
BEFORE
var a;
var b;
var c;
a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + "String!";

AFTER
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";
a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + "String!";

__________________
Case Sensitivity in Variables
all variables and function names are case sensitive.
MYVAR /= MyVar or myvar
Best Practice is camelCase
BEFORE
var StUdLyCapVaR;
var properCamelCase;
var TitleCaseOver;
STUDLYCAPVAR = 10;
PRoperCAmelCAse = "A String";
tITLEcASEoVER = 9000;

AFTER
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
